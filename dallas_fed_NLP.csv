"I am concerned that the Saudis will not be able  to hold together the production cuts. The recapitalization of the U.S. shale  industry will lead to immediate production from drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs)  but no real lowering of breakeven costs. At the American Petroleum Institute  Lafayette Chapter meeting last Monday, a portfolio manager from JPMorgan Chase  presented breakeven costs per shale basin that were higher than 2012 breakeven  costs presented by Morgan Stanley. West Texas Intermediate oil dropping below  $45 per barrel will lead to lower wellhead prices and cutbacks in production. We  will see some Chapter 22 bankruptcies with some of the marginal producers who  have recapitalized but have not improved their basic economics. All of this  presumes that the Administration does not impose some sort of import tariff,  quota or a border adjustment tax.",Comment,2017Q1,Negative,"Oil Price Outlook, Tariffs & Trade, Cost Inflation, Service Sector Margin Pressure, Regulation & Politics, Capital Discipline / Rig Count",Unknown

"Commodity pricing is a complex subject, and  supply vs. demand is a basic component of how market pricing is driven. At a  national level, absent implementation of some type of national proration (as to  oil production), production output, and thus inventory levels, are likely to  continue to increase (absent increased demand) to some point where commodity  prices will soften, and production output will flatten or decline. This will  perpetuate a cycle of sharp commodity price peaks and troughs. Absent the  ability to balance supply/demand globally, price volatility will inevitably  continue. The inability to realistically project commodity prices is one of the  biggest planning challenges faced by a small upstream oil and gas producer.",Comment,2017Q1,Negative,Oil Price Outlook,Unknown

"Permian Basin production will easily replace the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) cuts by the end of  the year. Meanwhile, storage continues to increase and demand is increasing  slowly. All of this will exert downward pressure on the price of oil.  Additionally, the recent purchases of acreage in the Permian Basin are out of  line with reality. The buyers cannot possibly drill up all the acquired acreage  before the primary terms of the purchased leases expire.

Too many rigs have gone back to work. Capital  investment is driving drilling decisions rather than profitability.

I do not believe that the ultimate projected  recoveries from the non-conventional wells currently being drilled in the  Permian Basin will measure up to expectations. They will thus prove uneconomic  at oil prices below $50 per barrel. The indicated decline curves are  exponential rather than hyperbolic.

I believe that $85 per barrel will be needed  for sustained production increases from these non-conventional resources at  current cost levels.,Comment,2017Q1,Negative,"Oil Price Outlook, Cost Inflation",Unknown
"Permian production is dependent on growth in global  demand over this period. If demand remains flat, then we will essentially  remain oversupplied given the ability to produce high volumes over short  periods.

A bright spot is natural gas  prices, but this has a limited impact in some markets due to pipeline  constraints. While NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas is priced at $4.50 per million  British thermal units, there are Permian operators paying pipelines to take  their gas rather than flare it due to constraints. It seems that the most  important factor for E&P companies drilling for natural gas is location,  location, location.",Comment,2018Q4,Neutral,"Oil Price Outlook, Tariffs & Trade, Service Sector Margin Pressure, Capital Discipline / Rig Count, Natural Gas Sentiment",E&P

Reserves have been overestimated significantly. The big  private equity money had all it could stand of outgo and no appreciable return,  with more consolidations to come. We found an ocean of oil and gas in the  Permian, but its long-term development and utilization will require massive  amounts of capital, and its returns will solidify for those with the capital to  deploy with long-term strength.

"The EIA has no clue on their estimated number of  DUCs, in my opinion. Their current estimate is approximately 8,000 total DUCs  in the U.S. The DUC definition needs to be defined as a well that has been  drilled down to the producing formation and also drilled horizontally all the  way to the end of the lease. In other words, for a Permian Basin well, that  means a well which has been drilled 10,000 feet down and 10,000 feet out. What  actually happens in the oil field is a smaller, “spudder” rig goes out to the  lease first and drills down to approximately 1,500–2,000 feet and sets surface  pipe, moves on to the next well, and does the same thing over and over. By  doing this, the larger, bigger and more expensive drilling rig doesn’t have to  spend its higher day rate to drill and set the surface pipe. What is occurring  is the EIA is counting all of these 1,500–2,000-foot spudder wells in  their total DUC count! Another thought to consider is, if these wells cost $4  million to drill and then another $5 million to complete—with 8,000 DUCs, with a $4  million per [well] drilling cost, that would be $32 billion. Is this the main  E&P issue now? Have they truly spent $32 billion on just the drilling of  these wells and they somehow have decided to leave them shut in and therefore  not complete them when they desperately need the cash flow? I’ve spoken to  several of the large shale operators in the Permian and they only have a few  true DUCs on their books, not thousands. See if you can have the EIA readjust  their number so the world knows the truth about how many true DUCs (all the way  down and all the way out) are out there.

This would not only prevent waste, but would also slow the pace of drilling, decrease field production and drive natural gas prices up to a reasonable level. Low-production wells are going to be prematurely plugged, with the resource lost, if natural gas prices do not improve soon.

An overreaction to an ill-informed misstated “problem” would be detrimental to future investments and not actually address the root cause of the recent flaring. The root cause was onetime events (fires) which inhibited gatherers and processors from taking the already connected natural gas.

"The Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies have harmed the energy complex. At the beginning of zero interest rate policy, the cost of capital for E&P was lowered to a point where firms drilled far too much, leading to a massive supply glut (and large job losses). Because their fixed income returns were so low, institutional investors needed to park capital in “creative” ways, which led to a massive bubble in private equity capital. Now, with so many companies failing, banks refuse to clear the deck and take a loss because they cannot earn interest on new loans to any other customers. When banks take assets to a bankruptcy auction, they can expect 80 percent or more in losses on their capital but can only loan that capital back out at 3 to 4 percent; what banker is in a hurry to make that decision? This zombification of companies ensures that capital is not being directed to its highest and best use. We are seeing the cycle repeat in renewables now.

"RBLs [reserve-based lending] used to be a valuable industry tool until the financial markets all went berserk and gaga over ""all things and everything Permian"" or shale. Money for any other basins or areas and especially for conventional development was just ""eliminated"" from the conversation. Significant money was ""churned"" for over 10 years by lots of companies engaged in development of shale. Zero-percent money is not creating a healthy industry; it merely means that big financial providers and huge corporations can play games with free money. Independent producers, unless you already had assets, or flocked to play the shale world, were and are left out. It has not been very healthy for the industry.

I am focused on making money, and I have no desire to just churn zero-percent interest loans and, frankly, like I said above, RBLs are not readily available unless one was and/or is engaged in development of shale. ""No-cost money"" simply enables publicly traded companies to appear successful to investors when in reality they churn money for management and financial groups and leave stockholders short of any real returns.

"I haven’t seen a good plan on a rollout of a “carbon tax”—i.e., how it would be applied, what industries, what levels, who collects it, who administers it, who actually pays for it and where, and what will become of the tremendous funds collected. Logic says the most ineffective player (U.S. government) will be the collector, with the leakage spilling out to fund political action groups that have absolutely no connection to energy in the first place. Otherwise, the smallest carbon tax pricing I’ve seen in the press has been only $25.00 per ton of CO2 emissions equivalent. Further readings indicate this converts to approximately $10.75 per barrel, considering a range of U.S.-produced crude oils. I have seen some politicians proposing a $60.00 or more per-ton initial carbon tax, with annual escalations. That’s $25.80 per barrel if assessed at the wellhead for U.S. production.

"Just look to Europe for what an energy “revolution” looks like instead of an “evolution.” There are unintended consequences. Historically high power prices caused by low wind speeds, cold weather and low solar irradiance are the result of underinvestment in traditional natural gas power and transportation infrastructure (and a general antagonism toward nuclear energy). There is a massive unintended consequence: higher carbon emissions. Per [an analyst quoted in] theNew York Times: “Around $41 per million British thermal units, the gas futures are priced at more than 10 times what gas is selling for in the United States and comparable to about $230 a barrel for oil.” What happens? Analysts estimate that gas-to-oil switching for power is over one million barrels per day. If countries in the Middle East can sell natural gas for over $230 per barrel of oil equivalent, they sell gas and burn oil for electricity instead (i.e., gas-to-oil switching), resulting in higher carbon emissions than if we were just using natural gas all along.",Question,2021Q4,Negative,"Oil Price Outlook, Geopolitical Risk, Cost Inflation, Natural Gas Sentiment",Unknown

"“Inexpensive”  is a subjective view relative to natural gas prices. Over the past five-plus  years, natural gas commodity pricing has materially impacted supply much  greater than demand in the U.S. This has resulted in abnormally low natural gas  pricing over this period. As liquefied natural gas exports grow and natural gas  volume growth in the U.S. moderates, natural gas pricing has increased and a  new higher-floor pricing has emerged. While this pricing is higher in the U.S.  relative to nearly all other areas around the world, U.S. gas consumers  (individual and commercial) still enjoy the benefit of lower fuel cost inputs  than others. Even at a hypothetical $7 per million British-thermal-units price,  U.S. power generation still provides a material cost advantage to U.S.  manufacturers. So, yes, it is more apparent that very low natural gas pricing  is unlikely to return. However, the U.S. natural gas price for consumers is  still highly competitive and in many ways advantageous relative to other  western countries.

"I am  in the East Texas Basin, and a large portion of its shale gas being produced is  within an area that is a potential disaster waiting to happen as to produced  water management. The primary zone used in the counties along the Louisiana  state line is the Rodessa-Gloyd. It is not an area with large production, yet  it has been allowed to become way over-pressurized. Some, if not most, of the  injection wells are doing so way over frack gradient pressures. That results in  water being fracked up into other zones. They are now beginning to allow even  shallower zones to be used for disposal, and those zones again are not  sub-pressure. Another byproduct of this practice is that any effort to drill a  well nearby is challenging due to the pressure one experiences at such shallow  depths. The drilling mud has to be designed to accommodate an abnormal  pressure. Doing so affects all the other zones due to the elevated mud weight. All the exposed zones  become targets of mud ingestion. To resolve this, an operator has to run casing  to wall off this issue within the well bore, and to do so greatly increases the  cost to drill. This  also risks impacting fresh drinking water tables even though there is surface  casing in all wells. Produced water is not only very high in salt content but  is exposed to oxygen due to trucking and storage in tanks. When salt water is  mixed with free oxygen, it causes corrosion to any wells previously drilled  that have casing exposed to the particular injected shallower zones.
